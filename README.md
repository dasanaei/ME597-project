### Classification of Soil Using Multi-Spectral Imagery From the Landsat Satellite
__Abstract:__
The following report is an analysis of the application of artificial intelligence to the field of satellite remote sensing. Given a large dataset of pixel values and their corresponding soil classification, the report evaluates the accuracy and effectiveness of several different classification models. Through the analysis of vital performance metrics, two models are chosen and are then utilized in finding key trends in the dataset. Overall, the mission of this paper is to determine which models are most desirable and what discoveries are hidden within the Landsat image data.
